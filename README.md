# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Background

We have been asigned to: 
  1- The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
  2- The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
  3: A written report on the employee database analysis
  
  In this report we will summarizes our analysis to helps prepare our manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.



Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title (50 points)
Using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries,
create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions — you’ll need to 
use the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. 
Then, use the COUNT() function to create a final table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.
