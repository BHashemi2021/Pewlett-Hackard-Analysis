# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Background
Pewlett Hackard is a large long-established company with many employees. Baby boomers who have been born between the years 1946-1964 are 57-75 years now and consequently many are in the retirement age. Their retirement has even been likened to a grey tsunami and Pewlett Hackard is no exception among other large organizations that will have to be prepare a contingency plan to manage a prevailing human resource disaster. As a result, we have been tasked to prepare a list of those who are retiring soon.
Using the ERD we created in this module as a reference and knowledge of SQL queries, we will create a Retirement Titles table that will hold all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions— we will need to use the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. Then, we will use the COUNT() function to create a final table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.

#### We have been asigned to: 
  1- The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
  2- The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
  3: A written report on the employee database analysis
  

Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title (50 points)
Using the ERD you created in this module
